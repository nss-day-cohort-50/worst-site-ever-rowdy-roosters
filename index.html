            <h3><strong>Mission Statement –</strong></h3>
            <p>Every day there are dozens of Rubber Chickens that are abandoned,
             abused, and in desperate need of help. Here at Rubber Chicken Rescue™,
              we are on the front lines protecting and saving the lives of Rubber Chickens 
              that are in times of crisis. We are dedicated to improving the welfare of 
              Rubber Chickens in our community through shelter, placement, education, and 
              awareness. Our hope for the future is that there will be no unwanted, unloved or 
              abandoned Rubber Chickens. We believe that with the involvement of our community 
              (and massive donations) we will make a significant impact on the welfare of those 
              Rubber Chickens that are in need, but we need your help and understanding. 
              Together, we will make the difference.
