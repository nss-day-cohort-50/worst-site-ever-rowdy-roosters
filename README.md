Mission Statement: Rescuing


<aside>Mission Statement –
	 Every day there are dozens of Rubber Chickens that are abandoned, abused, and in desperate need of help. Here at Rubber Chicken Rescue ™, we are on the front lines protecting and saving the lives of Rubber Chickens that are in times of crisis. We are dedicated to improving the welfare of Rubber Chickens in our community through shelter, placement, education, and awareness. Our hope for the future is that there will be no unwanted, unloved or abandoned Rubber Chickens. We believe that with the involvement of our community (and massive donations) we will make a significant impact on the welfare of those Rubber Chickens that are in need, but we need your help and understanding. Together, we will make the difference.</aside>
